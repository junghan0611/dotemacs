;;;; Visit Tangled File

;; After tangling a file, you might want to take a look at it. But a single org file can tangle out to more than one file, so how to choose? Each block could have its one file, as would the particular language-specific blocks in a section or the entire file. I don’t care to be too pendantic here, because I often know the name of the file.

;; Perhaps a little function to map a /language/ to a file name:

(defun ha-org-babel-tangle-default (language)
  "Return the default tangled file based on LANGUAGE."
  (format "%s.%s"
          (file-name-sans-extension (buffer-file-name))
          (pcase language
            ("emacs-lisp" "el")
            ("elisp" "el")
            ("python" "py")
            ;; ("ruby" "rb")
            ;; ...
            ("bash" "sh")
            ("sh" "sh")
            ("shell" "sh"))))

;; This function returns the name of the tangled file based on either the block or a default name based on the file name:

(defun ha-org-babel-tangle-file-name ()
  "Return _potential_ file name or Org source.
  If nearest block has a `:tangle' entry, return that.
  If block doesn't have `:tangle' (or set to `yes'),
  return the filename based on the block's language."
  (save-excursion
    (org-previous-block 1)
    (when (looking-at
           (rx "#+begin_src"
               (one-or-more space)
               (group (one-or-more (not space)))
               (one-or-more space) (zero-or-more any)
               (optional
                (group ":tangle" (one-or-more space)
                       (optional "\"")
                       (group (one-or-more any))
                       (optional "\"")))))
      (let ((language (match-string 1))
            (filename (match-string 3)))
        (if (or (null filename) (equal filename "yes") (equal filename "true"))
            (ha-org-babel-tangle-default language)
          filename)))))

;; And this function calls =find-file= on the tangled file (if found):

(defun ha-org-babel-tangle-visit-file ()
  "Attempt to call `find-file' on Org's tangled file."
  (interactive)
  (let ((tangled-file (ha-org-babel-tangle-file-name)))
    (if (file-exists-p tangled-file)
        (find-file tangled-file)
      (message "Looking for %s, which doesn't exist." tangled-file))))

;;;;; :comments link 활용

;; *Note:* You can /return/ to the original Org file with =org-babel-tangle-jump-to-org=, if you set the tangle =comments= to =link=, as in this global property:
;; ,#+PROPERTY: header-args:emacs-lisp :tangle yes :comments link

;;;; Navigating Code Blocks

;; I’ve been using Oleh Krehel’s (abo-abo) [[https://github.com/abo-abo/avy][Avy project]] to jump around the screen for years, and I just learned that I can wrap the =avy-jump= function to provide either/or regular expression and action to perform.

;; For instance, the following function can be used to quickly select a source code block, and jump to it:

(require 'avy)
(defun avy-jump-org-block ()
  "Jump to org block using Avy subsystem."
  (interactive)
  (avy-jump (rx line-start (zero-or-more blank) "#+begin_src")
            :action 'goto-char)
  ;; Jump _into_ the block:
  (forward-line))

;; I need to take advantage of this feature more.

;;;; Evaluating Code

;; Hitting ~C-c C-c~ in a source code block /evaluates/ the code. Simple, sure, but the following enhancements make this more accessible.

(defun org-babel-execute-src-block-at-point (&optional point)
  "Call `org-babel-execute-src-block' at POINT."
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char point)
    (org-babel-execute-src-block)))

(defun avy-org-babel-execute-src-block ()
  "Call `org-babel-execute-src-block' on block given by Avy.
  Use Avy subsystem to select a visible Org source code block,
  e.g. `#+begin_src', and then executes the code without moving
  the point."
  (interactive)
  (avy-jump (rx line-start (zero-or-more blank) "#+begin_src")
            :action 'org-babel-execute-src-block-at-point))

(defun org-babel-execute-subtree (prefix)
  "Execute all Org source blocks in current subtree.
  The PREFIX is passed to `org-babel-execute-buffer'."
  (interactive "P")
  (save-excursion
    (org-narrow-to-subtree)
    (org-babel-execute-buffer prefix)
    (widen)))

(defun org-babel-edit-src-block-at-point (&optional point)
  "Call `org-babel-execute-src-block' at POINT."
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char point)
    (org-edit-src-code)))

(defun avy-org-babel-edit-src-block ()
  "Call `org-edit-src-code' on block given by Avy.
  Use Avy subsystem to select a visible Org source code block,
  e.g. `#+begin_src', and then executes the code without moving
  the point."
  (interactive)
  (avy-jump (rx line-start (zero-or-more blank) "#+begin_src")
            :action
            'org-babel-edit-src-block-at-point))
